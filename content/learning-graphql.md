title: Learning GraphQL
---

GraphQL is a query language created by Facebook in 2012 to provide a
common interface between clients and servers by defining their data
capabilities and requirements.

While GraphQL is commonly thought of as an API technology for
frontend applications (especially [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/)),
it's generally applicable for other uses, too.

Before using Absinthe, you should familiarize yourself with GraphQL in
general. (Just keep in mind you'll be writing Elixir, not JavaScript!)
